# Scene Buidler Project
This is a scene building application, written with OpenGL, that is meant to work with the ray tracer I wrote for my 3rd year dissertation. The ray tracer github project can be found at https://github.com/PanagiotisPtr/Raytracer

## Running and using the application
The application binaries can be found in the latest release. There's also a detailed manual which is located at manual/manual.pdf. The manual also contains information relevant to the ray tracer but you can focus on the scene builder section.

## How to run the code
The code has only be tested on Windows. Because Apple has dropped support for OpenGL, you will need either windows or linux to run it. As this is only a Visual Studio project, building on Linux might be difficult.

On windows all you have to do is open the project in visual studio and run it. All the libraries needed are packaged with the source code and are linked in the project.
